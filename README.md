# CVP-impl

## Quick Start

To get started, clone this repository. From within the src folder, run the command:
```
make cvp
```
Then you should have an exectuble named `cvp` in the `/src` directory!

Run the program as
```
./cvp dim <basis> <target>
```
where dim is the dimension of the lattice, basis is a txt file where basis vectors are separated by lines and elements are separated by spaces, and target is a txt file with elements separated by spaces. See basis.txt and target.txt for an example input.
